== Session view
Session View is an investigation tool that allows you to view and analyze Linux process data organized
in a tree according to the Linux logical event model, with processes organized by parentage.
It displays events in a highly readable format inspired by the terminal, making it a powerful tool for monitoring
and investigating remote session activity on your Linux infrastructure, and understanding user and service behaviour.
It is currently in beta. This page describes how to enable and use Session View.

[[how-to-enable-session-view]]
=== Enable session view
Session View uses process data collected by the {endpoint-sec} integration,
but this data is not collected by default. To enable Session View, navigate to the Endpoint Security
integration and edit one or more of your integration policies. Search the policy settings for “session data”,
and enable “Include session data” near the bottom of the page. Only data collected by agents with this setting
enabled can be viewed in Session View.  For more information about the additional
fields collected by the agent when this setting is enabled, see https://www.elastic.co/[placeholder link].

=== Find session view
Session View is accessible from the Hosts, Alerts, and Timelines pages.
In general, to open Session View you will first find an event or session you wish to view,
then click *Open Session View* under *Actions*. For example:

**On the Alerts page**
* Go to *Detect* -> *Alerts*, then scroll down to view the Alerts table.
Events viewable in Session View have a square **Open Session View** icon under **Actions**:

=== Visual event analyzer UI
When you click Open Session View, the following display appears. Each labeled feature is described below:

[role="screenshot"]

1. The Close Session and Full screen buttons.
2. The search bar finds and highlights search terms within the current session.
You can use the buttons on the right side of the search bar to jump through search results.
3. The display settings button. Click here to toggle the display of timestamps, and verbose mode.
With verbose mode enabled, Session View shows all processes created in a session, including shell startup,
shell completion, and forks caused by built-in commands.
It defaults to *off* in order to highlight the data most likely to be user-generated and non-standard.
4. The details pane button. Click it to toggle the details pane, which appears below the button
and displays a wide range of additional information about the selected process’s ancestry and host,
and any associated alerts. In the example above, the startup process is selected.
To select a process, click on it.
5. The startup process. In this example it shows that the session was a bash session.
It also shows the Linux user who started the session.
6. The *Child processes* button allows you to expand or collapse a process’s children.
You can also expand collapsed alerts, output, and scripts where they appear.
Collapsed processes will automatically expand when they match a search.
